# Student_Dropout_Prediction_Deployment
# Student Dropout Prediction from E-Learning Portal

This project analyzes student engagement patterns on an e-learning platform (like Udemy) to predict dropout behavior using machine learning and feature engineering. 
It includes synthetic data generation, outlier simulation, imputation, visualization, and strategic business recommendations.

## ✨ Project Highlights

- ✅ Generates 10,000 clean, balanced records
- ⚠️ Adds 5,000 noisy, imbalanced records for outlier detection
- 📊 Provides insightful visualizations: device trends, satisfaction buckets, progress vs dropout
- 🧠 Uses Random Forest for feature importance
- 🚨 Flags high-risk students based on behavioral thresholds
- 📋 Recommends targeted actions for retention
